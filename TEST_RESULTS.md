## Bug Fixes Applied

During testing, the following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Next.js 15 Params Type Error ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Route params are now Promises in Next.js 15
**Fix:** Updated all route handlers to use `await params`
- Fixed: `/api/assessor-applications/[id]/route.ts`
- Fixed: `/api/assessor-applications/[id]/analyze/route.ts`
- Fixed: `/api/assessor-applications/[id]/review/route.ts`

### 2. Null Safety in Form Parser ‚úÖ
**Issue:** TypeError when checking if null values are file fields
**Fix:** Added null checks in `isFileField()` function
- File: `src/lib/parse-assessor-form.ts:158-163`

### 3. Optional Qualifications Array ‚úÖ
**Issue:** TypeScript error for potentially undefined qualification arrays
**Fix:** Added null safety checks in page component
- File: `src/app/assessor-applications/[id]/page.tsx:288-325`

### 4. Submission Date Type ‚úÖ
**Issue:** `undefined` not assignable to `string | null`
**Fix:** Ensured submission date defaults to `null` if undefined
- File: `src/lib/parse-assessor-form.ts:23`
